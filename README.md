# hayden_kscope2018
So far it's just the initial install here. Install HAYDEN_KSCOPE2018.sql preserving the workspace id to create the workspace and associated schema. This also takes care of the grants and privilages. Then run trunk/release/_release.sql to create the packages and tables. Finally, install trunk/apex/f130.sql and you're done.
